    <p class="hero-header">
        In this blog I am going to tell how React works and major things that are used in react,so First come first,you might be thinking what this react basically is?
        so React basically a User Interface based library which works on frontEnd of your website.It is decribed as Javascript library which is developed by facebook.
        This make single pages programme which can be reusable components.It could support different types of framework and work with them Like Angular.React can be performed on both server side as well as on client side.
        It is used form developing amazing User Interface components.
    <h1 class="sec-header header">why we use React?</h1>
        <p class="hero-header ">
        Best of part using react is It is more secure ,fast and the simplest in all the js library.As it is simple so React can be learn easily without needed much knowledge.
        There are keys in react which specifies in array. which means it is identifier defines in array which perform different operations with key value pair where every value has its own key which is used to uniquely identify the key with others key.
        
    <h1 class="sec-header header blo-head">Different Things that we can perform on React.
        some of the examples are:</h1>
        <ul type="none">
            <li"><h1>1.JSX:</h1> <p class="hero-header">
                JSX is a stands for Javascript xml.JSX is used for writing html code into Javascript format {} in react. 
            </p>
        </li>
            
            <li><h1>2.components:</h1>
            <p class="hero-header">
                Everything works in React is on components.we can define different components for each part.components makes code efficiency.
            </p></li>
            <li><h1>2.useState():</h1>
                <p class="hero-header">
                    This useState is used when there needs to change the state of your programme.
                </p></li>
                

        </ul>
